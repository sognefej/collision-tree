# collision-tree
A data structure for efficient collision detection in a 2D space

## Description
This is a data structure to increase the efficiency of detecting collisions in 2-dimensional space.  It uses a quad-tree to store elements and their locations in the tree and allows you to move the elements around in space and to detect elements within in a certain radius from an element.

## Installing
Installing the library is very straightforward.  Download `CollisionTree.jar` from the releases page, navigate to your project properties and add it to your libraries
